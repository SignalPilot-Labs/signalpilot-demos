# SignalPilot AI
SignalPilot is an AI-powered extension for Jupyter Notebooks. It can:

* write, debug and run jupyter code cells
* create and interpret plots
* read, understand, and analyze tabular data (csv/tsv/json/xlsx/html)
* directly connect to your databases and write SQL queries
* use your internal code and libraries, follow your custom rules
* perform tab autocomplete inside code cells

Built by leading AI and quant researchers from YC, Harvard, MIT, and Goldman Sachs, SignalPilot brings real-time, context-aware assistance directly into JupyterLab.

No hallucinated code. No context switching. Just faster insights.
